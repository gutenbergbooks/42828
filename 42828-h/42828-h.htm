<h2>I</h2>

<p class="indent">Was there ever a more romantic time
than our own, or a people who
took everything more matter-of-factly?
The paintings of a period contain all its
enthusiasms and illusions. We remember
the eighteenth century&mdash;at least in England&mdash;by
Reynolds&#39; and Gainsborough&#39;s art,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
the seventeenth century by Van Dyck&#39;s; and
when we remember the eighteenth century
in France, it is to think of Watteau,
who expressed what his world, drifting
towards disaster, cared about&mdash;an illusion
of a never-ending summer&#39;s day. These
names are expressive of their times, and
Sargent&#39;s art, with disillusioned outlook,
mirrors an obvious aspect of English life
to-day. Above all others he has taken his
world as it is, with the delight in life, in
its everyday appearance, with which the
representative artists of any period have
been gifted.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the next generation will feel
that it owes more to him than to any
painter of this time. For the ephemeralities
of the moment in costume and fashion
are the blossoms in which life seeks expression&mdash;whatever
its fruit. It is agreed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
that everything is expression, from a spring
bud bursting to a ribbon worn for a
moment against a woman&#39;s hair. And who
deals with the surface of life deals with
realities, for the rest is guess-work.</p>

<p class="indent">Often enough this content to take the
world as it is may result in things which
do not charm us, and perhaps Sargent has
never been one of those as fastidious in
selection as in delineation. Sometimes he
gives his sitters away&mdash;for there are traits
in human nature, belief in the very existence
of which we are always anxious
to forego. Nothing escapes him that is
written in the face. Yet he is not cynical,
but man of the world, the felicity of living
in a world where everything is charming
being only for those with the gift to live in
one of their own making.</p>

<p class="indent">The side of life which he expresses is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
that in which time seems given over wholly
to social amenities, long afternoons spent
in pleasant intercourse, hours well ordered
and protected, so that the most fragrant
qualities in human nature can if they will
spring to life. We almost hear the teacups
in the other room, and none of his
sitters seem really alone. We feel they
have left the life to which they belong to
sit to the artist but only for an hour or so.
The social world to which they belong will
absorb them again. This world Sargent
paints. Even in many of his single figures
we are conscious always of its existence in
the background. In portrait after portrait
there is scarcely a suggestion of self-consciousness&mdash;but
the man or the woman
just at the moment of posing, as if environed
still in an atmosphere of their
own, and of the world from which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
have withdrawn for the sitting. For it
is Sargent&#39;s gift to remove the impression
that his sitter has posed, that the dress
was arranged, and his gift to arrest his
sitter&#39;s habitual gesture, the impression of
sparkling stones, almost the clink of bangles
at the wrist in expression of the moment.
Most unjustly was it said that he could not
paint pretty women. It would appear to be
within his power to paint almost anything
that has its existence in fact, and if in a
matter-of-fact way, what more to the point
if the facts are so beautiful that fancy itself
would have to defer?</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Supreme is the art of Sargent in its appreciation
of those pleasures which would
almost seem for art alone: pearls upon the
colour of flesh; slight transitions of colour
charged with great secrets of beauty;
pearls painted as they would be regarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
by a lover, as ten thousand times more
beautiful than if they were lying in a
box. And the touches of the brush&mdash;for
Sargent shows every touch&mdash;breathe sympathy
with every change of colour as the
chain of pearls falls first across white silk
and then across black velvet, and the little
globes take to themselves new variations.
A fan is opened, and upon the ivory sticks
the light like silver trembles, a web of
colour is spun across upon the open ribs; a
book is half-open, it may be a Bradshaw,
but we will believe it is a book of old
verse, for everything that comes into the
picture, the particular picture of which I
am thinking, comes into a charmed circle.
There are people for whom the opulent
world of Sargent&#39;s art is their everyday
world&mdash;whose life competes with the
splendour of day-dreams. How essentially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
romantic&mdash;although so matter-of-fact&mdash;must
be the art that leaves us with this impression!
To be matter-of-fact is, we see,
far from being unromantic; the reverse
indeed is true, for with our face turned
from the world romance vanishes.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="indent">I once had occasion to call on Mr. Sargent,
and was shown into a room with
a black carpet. Only a colourist loves
black, and sees it as a colour. And this
room, so free from all that was novel and
without associations, helped to explain to
me why, though his method is so modern
and of the moment, his pictures of aristocrats
accommodate themselves to ancestral
surroundings. For it is true that not only
the face and the clothes of his sitters are
given, but somehow, in the material of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
paint, their social position and their distinction.
Now this is not by any means
the least of Sargent&#39;s qualities; it is
not a common one. Well-bred people
drive up to the door of a modern studio
almost visibly cloaked in the traditions
of their race, but we are led to believe
that they must have left all this behind
them in the carriage when we see the portrait
in an exhibition; the artist has shown
nothing of it, has used his distinguished
sitter simply as a model. For lack of
inspiration novelties are proffered in its
place, <i>L&#39;art nouveau</i> on canvas. Sargent
does not paint modern people as if they
all came into the world yesterday landed
from an airship. No, he is like Van Dyck,
who not only painted the beautiful clothes,
the long white hands, and the bearing of
his sitters sympathetically, but also the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
very atmosphere of the Court around them,
painting, as all great painters do, invisible
as well as visible things. If there is not
in Sargent&#39;s painting courtesy of touch, if
his method has not suavity in painting
elegant people, this is rather as it should
be in an age which trusts implicitly to the
dressmaker and tailor for its elegance.
And without a word here as to the worth
of some of our modern aims, at least the
age is too much in earnest for a pose.
The poses and fripperies of the pictures of
Van Dyck and Kneller are done with; and
besides, the modern baronet is not anxious
to show his hands, but is painted gloved,
and Work goes unimmortalised. Meunier
the sculptor and other modern artists
having gloried in the war of labour, its
victories go unsung; its victors surviving
only as fashionable men.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
The portraits of some painters suggest
nothing but the foreign atmosphere of a
studio, but Sargent seems to meet his
sitters in the atmosphere of their own
daily, fashionable life, and that is why his
pictures are romantic, for isn&#39;t there romance
wherever there is wealth? The
people whose wealth is such that they can
take as their own background all the
beautiful accessories of aristocratic tradition,
are entitled to them if they like them
well enough to spend their money in this
way. And it is the peculiar gift of our age
to recognise in ourselves the heirs of the
centuries of beautiful handicrafts, which we
close with our machines. They certainly
are the heirs to any kind of beauty who
have the imagination to enjoy it. And
the imagination for past associations, who
have this more than the Americans? We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
believe in England that all Americans are
rich, that they can buy whatever they appreciate.
So by the divine right of things
going to those who appreciate them, the
rich American is now, even as Sargent
paints him, environed by old French and
English things and their associations. And
in connection with the accessories in
Sargent&#39;s pictures, might we not ask the
question whether it could not be considered
a test of the worth or worthlessness,
from a point of beauty, of any
ornament or furniture whether it would
survive representation in a picture? How
much modern stuff we should have to
sweep aside! And now that one thinks of
it, modern pictures have left modern furniture
rather severely alone&mdash;the painters
have not been faithful to their brethren the
makers of modern tables and chairs. Who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
is more modern than Sargent&mdash;and I am
trying to think has he ever painted a
modern room&mdash;that is, a room with modern
things in it? The rooms that the most
modern people live in are oddly enough
the ones that are most old-fashioned, filled
with eighteenth-century things. This, to
reflect upon, has arisen through thinking
about Sargent&#39;s interior paintings, which
so very vividly and accurately reflect the
attitude of the modern world to its own
time. In that word modern, if we are not
using it too often, we must seek the nature
of Sargent&#39;s painting, its spirit; it is the
most interesting thing in connection with
painting to come as close as possible to its
spirit. And what a test before any work of
art, to ask whether it is worth a search for
the incorporeal element; although in vain, in
spite of Walter Pater, does painting aspire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;towards the condition of music,&quot; since music
is as ghostly as the ghosts that it contains.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="indent">Dancing has been a theme always
appealing to artists because of its rhythm,
its grace in reality, its incarnation of femininity.
It contains all the inspiration for a
painter in any one moment of movement.
No two things could be further removed from
each other than Lancret&#39;s &quot;La Camargo
Dansant&quot; and Sargent&#39;s &quot;Carmencita,&quot; yet
some alliterative resemblance in the name
and some resemblance in the dancers&#39;
costumes bring these two figures together
in my mind&mdash;the one the fairy artificial
dancer, the princess of an unreal world,
the other a vivid sinuous presentment.
With both painters the costume has interested
them as much almost as the figure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
for the dress of a dancer, indeed the dress
of any woman, is in a Sargent picture a
part of herself, nothing mere dead matter,
everything expressive, the brush having
come at once to the secret that no one
material thing is more spiritual than another.
For ever Carmencita stands, waiting for
the beginning of the music, just as La
Camargo is caught upon the wing of movement,
seeming to revive the music that was
played for her and cheating us with a
sense of a world happier than it is. In
Carmencita we have that living beauty from
which, after all, a dreamer must take every
one of his dreams. It is Sargent&#39;s wisdom
to stand thus close to life. In the sense of
this reality, and the difficulty of approach
to it with anything so constitutionally artificial
as a painter&#39;s colours, do we apprise
the real nature of his gifts. The roses on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
La Camargo&#39;s dress are artificial roses, but
not more artificial than her face and hands.
This figure is only a little nearer to nature
than a china shepherdess, it is the fancy
of a mind cheating itself with unrealities
as realities. Sargent himself has painted
artificial things, the rouge on lips, the
powder on a face; since it is natural for
some folk to rouge, that is the nature which
he paints. Only an imaginative woman
makes herself up. A painter with more
imagination than Sargent would enter into
the spirit of her arts. Sargent&#39;s betrayal
of his fashionable sitters has frightened
many, but if anything it has increased his
vogue; for above everything an imaginative
woman is curious to know what she looks
like to others, and a Sargent&#39;s portrait is
intimate, unflattering, perfectly candid but
perfectly true as an answer to her question.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
Everything on the stage is artificial; what
will this art, that has had of the reality of
things all its strength and life, make of a
purely theatrical picture&mdash;Miss Ellen Terry
in a famous part? The artificiality of the
stage always presents two aspects, that
one in which we forget its artificiality and
that other in which we remember it. And
this latter, to my mind, is the aspect in
which Sargent has painted this picture,
without, as it were, ever stepping over the
footlights into the world that only becomes
real on the other side of them. But the
exactness of his interpretation beautifully
explains the scene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Carnation Lily, Lily Rose&quot; was painted
in a garden by the Thames. Two children
are lighting up the Chinese lanterns, and in
their light and with flowers surrounding,
Sargent sees for a moment life itself by accident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
made idyllic. The picture is Japanese
in its sense of decoration, as if decoration and
idyllic moments always went together. It
would almost seem so from the study of
art, for without exception, those painters
who have been conscious of the ideal and
idyllic element in life, have always shown
this through composition which, whilst dealing
with a real scene, has taken a little of the
reality from it. There must be an essentially
musical element in the art which takes a
mood as well as a scene from nature, and
brings us by way of real scenes to that
imaginative country which exists in every
nature-lover&#39;s mind; a country partly made
up of the remembrance of other places
which have been like the place where he
now stands.</p>

<p class="indent">Great tiger-lilies hang over the children.
We almost expect in these surroundings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
pierettes or fantastic lovers, but we are
kept close to the beauty of reality by the
naturalism with which the children have
been painted. Not one touch is given as
a concession to their fairy and dramatic
background, not one ribbon, nothing in
the costume to enable them to enter into
the patterned world of art as part of a
design. For above everything the painter
has wished to persuade us of life itself as
a picture, and not of his ability to make
these children the motifs of design. Their
ordinariness irritates me personally, they do
not seem quite to belong to their fairy land,
but I recognise that this matter-of-factness
peculiarly belongs to Sargent&#39;s art and am
interested in the attitude that takes beauty
so matter-of-factly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span></p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="indent">No one has encountered the beauty of
woman&#39;s face more casually than Sargent,
no one has made us realise more fully its
significance as a fact in the world. After
all we had thought perhaps we were partly
deceived in this matter by the illusions
of poets and love-sick painters, but approaching
it without ecstasy, art has not
been closer to this beauty than here. I
am looking at a half-tone reproduction of
a lady by Sargent, wondering whether
in the history of English portrait painting
an artist has approached as closely to the
thoughts of his sitter. The expression of
the face is determined partly by thoughts
within, partly by light without. And it is
as if with the touch of a brush a thought
could be intercepted as it passed the lips.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
This is the nearest approach that thought
has ever had to material definition.
Thought is the architect of her expression,
by accuracy of painting it is copied, just
as the back of a fan or bracelet is copied&mdash;things
so material as that. So after all
thoughts are not so far away from the
material world with which we are in touch;
are scarcely less visible than air. The
impressionists have rendered air; and would
it be too far-fetched to hint that the
shadow on the lips almost serves to bridge
one province with another, the atmosphere
without and that which reigns within the
sitter&#39;s mind. It is when Sargent&#39;s brush
hesitates at the lips and eyes, at the threshold
of intimate revelation, that we really
begin to form an adequate conception of
his genius. Yes, of things fleeting, a
thought flitting across the face, interrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
gestures&mdash;and the mysterious suggestion of
conversation hanging fire between the sitter
and ourself, Sargent is the master. Sometimes
a portrait painter will create a face
on canvas, of pleasant expression, which
is not like his sitter, and it is as if with
every touch he could change the thoughts
as he changes the expression in the face
he is creating.</p>

<p class="cnomargins">Fairies&quot; and many charming children&#39;s books illustrated by their</p>
<p class="cnotmargin">author, himself an artist of high attainment.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Sargent&#39;s accuracy is such that the expression
that passes over the face in his
portraits is one which all the sitter&#39;s friends
recognise; so close is he in touch with the
delicate drawing, especially round the lips,
that his brush never strays by one little bit
into the realm of invention. There are
other painters painting as carefully, faces as
full of expression, who do not come near a
likeness of their sitter. In what provinces
close to nature are they wandering, since,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
striving to paint the face before them, they
paint another face? We must not forget, in
thinking of Sargent&#39;s greatness, that he unfailingly
is in close touch with his sitters&#39; expression,
that is, almost with their thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">Although Sargent has proved in many
landscapes his powers in that direction,
he too well enters into the spirit of
the portraiture to which he has put his
hand to attempt to introduce naturalistic
effects into backgrounds obviously painted
in a London studio. The landscape background
is sometimes charming if under these
circumstances it remains a convention; for
there are moments when nature herself is
out of place, pictures in which human nature
must be the only form of life,&mdash;with the
exception perhaps of flowers, for these
accompany human nature always, to revelries
where sunlight is excluded, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
to the tomb. It is art of little carrying
power that is exhausted upon some
transcript of beautiful detail, colour of
the glazes of a vase, a bunch of flowers.
Sargent embraces difficulties one after another
with energy unexpended. Physique,
but never genius will give out. Energy of
this order always goes with a generous,
because very human, outlook; success
on occasion being modified not through
failure to accomplish, but through failure
to respond.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class="indent">The life of a busy portrait painter, with
its demand for inspiration every morning,
is of the most exacting nature, and the
quality of the painter&#39;s output must of
necessity vary. The nervous strain is great,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
for sitters are capricious, and always is
the temptation present to the one sin
that is unforgivable, compromise with the
Philistine&mdash;the concession of genius to
stupidity, of perceptions nearly divine to
ignorance. Genius has always had difficulty
in working to order, yet nearly all
the great portraiture work in the world
has been done to order. But one imagines
that the conditions under which the masterpieces
of a modern painter, with so great
a vogue as Sargent&#39;s, have been produced
must be unparalleled by anything in the
history of ancient painting. A crowd
streamed through the studios of Gainsborough,
Reynolds, and Romney to be
painted, but the world was smaller then,
and their art was more easily done. They
worked within a convention narrower than
Sargent&#39;s, compromising with nature at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
very start; a convention more beautiful than
his, a garden, beautiful because it was confined
and seen in an accustomed light. If
things are beautiful at all they become more
so when they are no longer unaccustomed,
when they fit in with an old frame of mind.
Sargent deals with the unaccustomed&mdash;in
which at first perhaps we always see the
ugly&mdash;whilst, as we have said, he does not
destroy, as the vandalistic art of some
painters does, the connection between the
past and present. It is the present which
his art embraces, but we might almost say
we are never thoroughly accustomed to the
present until it has become the past. So
to us Sargent&#39;s art is not as beautiful as
Gainsborough&#39;s, for it has constantly to
throw over some old form of perfection to
embrace a new difficulty. In the eighteenth
century there was less variety in the life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
which art encountered. The life of even a
Gainsborough or a Reynolds would be circumscribed
in just the same way that their
art is circumscribed, uninterrupted in its
mood, and beauty is to be found in uninterrupted
moods.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class="indent">Something should now be said of
Sargent&#39;s method&mdash;of that which is spoken
of as his technique. And of method, it is
not something to be separated from the
painter&#39;s temperament, it is always autographic.
Somehow, temperament shows
even in a person&#39;s handwriting, giving it
what is really its style, though the fashion
of writing imposed upon a pupil by his
master is also called a style. In art there
is no word that is oftener debated. And of
those who speak most of style in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
own work, the measure of their self-consciousness
in the matter is often the
measure of their distance from it. They
are in the position of a schoolboy taking
writing lessons, and their style, if ever
they are to have one, does not begin until
thinking and painting have become for
them almost one process. But this is a
difficult matter to make clear, and apology
should perhaps be forthcoming for touching
on so debatable a point thus hurriedly.
I may have said something perhaps to
convey to the lay reader the significance
of the particular method of treating his
subjects which we identify with Sargent.
The pupil of Carolus Duran, his
method was formed under the most modern
influences; whatever effect quite another
kind of training might have had on Sargent,
still nothing but the traceable element of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
self would have determined for us his style.
The method of applying paint to canvas
has always resolved itself into more or less
a personal question, though certain schools
are to be identified with different ways of
seeing; every method is a convention, and
the difference of conventions always one of
vision, affecting handling only in the sense
that it has to be accommodated to the
vision. It would be out of place here, perhaps,
and far too technical, to define the
difference between such a method as
Sargent&#39;s and say that of Pre-Raphaelitism.
But roughly, the Pre-Raphaelite concentrates
on each object. For each object, say
in a room, is in turn his subject as he paints
that room. The impressionist, Sargent, only
has the one subject, that room, the different
objects in it explaining themselves
only in so far as their surfaces and character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
are defined in the general impression by the
way they take the light&mdash;in short, almost
an impression as it would be received on
a lens. If we remember all this we can
appreciate the extreme sensitiveness both
of Sargent&#39;s vision and touch. For his
brush conveys almost with the one touch&mdash;so
spontaneous in feeling is his work&mdash;not
only the amount but the shape of the light
on any surface. Thus the shapes of everything
in the picture are finally resolved, and
we might also say without curiosity as to
their causes. We are given the impression,
which would have been our own impression:
since in regard to a portrait, for instance,
when we meet a person our curiosity does
not immediately extend to such details as
the character and number of buttons on
his coat. With this method always goes
spontaneity, Sargent&#39;s pre-eminent gift. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
values it so highly that he does not scruple
to recommence a picture more than once
and carry it through again in the one
mood, if in the first instance his art may
have miscarried, not permitting himself to
doctor up the first attempt. To the constant
sense of freshness in his work which
such a way of working must imply, I
think a great measure of his vogue is to
be attributed, though others have coloured
more prettily, flattered more, and subordinated
themselves to the amiable ambitions
of their sitters.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class="indent">Is it a fancy?&mdash;but I see a resemblance
between the art of Sargent and that in
writing of Mr. Henry James. The same
pleasure in nuances of effect in detail, and
the readiness to turn to the life at hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
for this. To enjoy Sargent is above all to
appreciate the means by which he obtains
effect in detail, the economy of colour and
of brush marks with which he deceives the
eye, and the quality of subtle colour in
the interpretation of minor phenomena. On
the large scale, in the general effect, the
quality of his colour is sometimes uninviting.
But when at its best it takes the
everyday colour of things as if it was colour,
without the hysterical exaggeration with
which so much youthful contemporary art
attempts to cheat itself and other people.
If Sargent&#39;s admirers do not claim that he
sees all the colour there is in things, they
claim for him that he sees colour and has
the reverence for reality which prevents a
tawdry emphasis upon it for the sake of
sweetness of effect. And after the sweetmeat
vagaries, which have followed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
wake of Whistler, by those without that
master&#39;s self-control, this is refreshing.</p>

<p class="indent">Sargent&#39;s brush seems to trifle with things
that are trifling, to proceed thoughtfully in
its approach to lips and eyes. In painting
accessories around his sitters there is the
accommodation of touch to the importance
of the objects suggested, and nowadays,
since interior painting is the fashion&mdash;to
suit the taste of a young man of genius imposing
his peculiar gift upon the time&mdash;there
are many portraits where the sitter is
brought into line with an elaborate setting
out of <i>objets d&#39;art</i>, the painter&#39;s pleasure
in the treatment of these manifesting itself
sometimes at the sitter&#39;s expense. Translating
everything by the methods we have
described, Sargent preserves throughout
his pictures a certain quality of paint. The
impression of the characteristic surface of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
any material is made within this quality,
by the responsiveness of his brush to the
subtlest modification of effect which differentiates
between the nature of one surface
and another, as they are influenced by the
light upon them at the moment. There are
painters who do not translate reality into
paint in this way, but who have striven to
imitate the surface qualities of objects by
varying, imitative ways of applying their
paint. Sargent is not this kind of realist.</p>

<p class="cnotmargin">Watts, O.M.R.A.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">He is a realist in the sense that Goya,
the great Spanish painter of the eighteenth
century, was one, for the Spaniard had just
such an eagerness to come closer to the
sense of life than the close imitation of
its outside could bring him. Sargent is
more polite, less impetuous, but still it is
life as it is, that quickens his brush and
informs all his virtuosity. His technique
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
presents life vividly, but presents it to us
with a sense of accomplishment in art, the
equivalent of the accomplished art of living
of the majority of his sitters. I am thinking
of a portrait of a lady, and she is turning
the leaves of a book, and in the lowered
eyes, and the movement of the hand, there
is more than arrested movement, there is an
expression of an attitude consciously assumed
which ordinarily would have been an
unconscious one, and so accurate is the
painting, that the sitter is detected as it
were in this self-consciousness. In portraits
of a ceremonial order, for people to sit in
a group with a pleasant indispensable air
of naturalness, is of course an affair on the
artist&#39;s part of very thoughtful arrangement.
But while composition should not betray the
affectation of natural movement, movement
must not be conveyed in a merely sensational,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
snapshot manner. For the slightest
reflection on this matter will betray to us
that in the latter pretension we are cheated,
since we cannot fail to remember that to
complete the canvas the sitter must have recovered
the pose day after day, hour after
hour, in the studio. Sargent&#39;s instincts are
so tuned to the appropriate, having the tact
which itself is art, that whilst in this kind of
portraiture we do not question the grouping
or the movement of his sitters as unreal, we
do not accept it as quite natural. We instinctively
know that in proportion as it is
made to look too natural it would be unreal,
untrue to the conditions which the painter&#39;s
art actually encountered. Sargent, who
permits nothing to stand between him and
nature, will not permit such an inartistic lie
to stand between us and the sincerity of his
painting. He does not betray us in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
love of what is of the moment, by giving
us sham of this kind instead of the real
thing.</p>

<p class="indent">At every point at which we take his
art and examine it, the evidence all points
to one form of success. The sitters posing
are really posing, their action is not even
made unnaturally real as we have shown,
and in the distances in the room round
them, there is the reality of space dividing
them from things at the other end of the
room. Reality, within the confines of the
particular truths to which his method is
subject, has been the evident intention all
through his art. From this standpoint it
often compels admiration in cases where it
would have to be withdrawn were we substituting
in our mind another ideal, examining
his work, for instance, only in the light
of a sensitive colour beauty which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
painter has not put first and foremost.
Some artists have embraced reality only
as it justified their imagination. If we
look on Sargent&#39;s art for anything inward
except that which looks through the eyes
and determines the smile of his sitter, we
shall find our sympathies break down. Unnecessary
perhaps to say this, yet it were as
well to make quite clear the light in which
we should regard the work of an artist
who has wholly succeeded in self-expression,
the only known form of success in art.</p>

<p class="indent">In analysing some men&#39;s work, we wish
above all to know them, to know the mind
that thus environs itself. With others it is
their art which tempts us to further and
further knowledge of its truths while, as
with Shakespeare, the artist behind it becomes
impersonal. Thus it is with Sargent&#39;s
art. It is true that if we wish to know an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
artist we can never under any circumstances
become more intimate with him than
in his art, whether we find him in it
far away in remote valleys or at the centre
of fashionable life. And this though the
dreamer may be a man of fashion and the
painter of society live a life retired.</p>

<p class="indent">Of Sargent&#39;s water-colours, much might
be said. To some extent they explain his
oils, yet he seems to allow himself in them
a greater freedom, just as the medium
itself is freer than that of oils&mdash;more accidental,
and the masters of this art control
its propensity for accidental effect as its
very spirit, guiding it with skill to results
which baffle and perplex by the ingenuity
with which they give illusion. First, as
last, a painter has to accept the fact that he
conveys nothing except by illusion; that
he can never bring his easel so close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
subject, or his materials to such minuteness
of touch, that his art becomes pure imitation;
nor can he secure the adjustment of
proportion between a large subject and a
small panel which would give in every case
such imitation. The supreme artist accepts
the standpoint first instead of last, and
the greater his art becomes, the greater his
power in its mysterious control of effect.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p class="indent">There are some painters whose work
we may personally wholly dislike&mdash;dislike
their outlook&mdash;even our favourite subjects
becoming intolerable to us in their
art. It is something in their nature antipathetic
to our own. Of course, mediocre
work does not assume such proportions in
our mind. Then there are painters who,
through some affinity of temperament with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
our own, make everything their art touches
pleasant to us. And then there are the
impersonal artists, Velazquez, Millais, and
Sargent, taking apparently quite an impersonal
view of life. Sargent&#39;s world is everybody&#39;s
world, and if we are affected one way
or another by it, it is as life affects us.</p>

<p class="indent">One has heard a painter say, &quot;I can
paint those things because I love them.&quot;
Judged by his treatment of so many things,
of nearly everything, how much must Sargent
love life. One man can paint flowers
and another marble&mdash;Sargent paints everything;
and, to paraphrase, almost it might
be said that what he doesn&#39;t paint isn&#39;t
worth painting. But all this is nothing if he
never penetrates, as Meissonier and others
never penetrated, below the surface; if
he gave no symbols in his art of things
invisible.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
We like some of the subjects he has
painted, others we dislike so much that we
wonder he has painted them; just as in
life there are people and surroundings to
which we are attracted, and others from
whom we keep away.</p>

<p class="indent">To the realist by temperament the
effect of the details of any scene accepted
direct from nature provide exciting inspiration,
and he least of all is likely to turn to
decorative composition, which, with its resemblance
to a form imposed in verse, only
aids in the interpretation of the subject in
proportion as it is imaginatively inspired. A
painter pre-occupied with the opportunities
which any incident may offer for the interpretation
of subtleties, will often accept any
scene from nature and almost any point of
view as composition. For the old formulas
of composition&mdash;of the time when composition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
was regarded as something to be taught&mdash;went
with a decorative conception of
things, was in itself a form of decoration.
And whilst it has been said that all art is
decorative, it will perhaps be found that the
naturalistic painter is too much excited
with incident to scheme much for a
rhythmic presentation of it in the frame.
Such a canvas as Sargent&#39;s &quot;Salmon
Fishing in Norway,&quot; lately exhibited in the
McCulloch collection, a portrait painted in
the open, of a youth resting on the bank
of a river with caught salmon and tackle
beside him, the centre of a skilfully painted
piece of landscape, is a case in point. The
difficulties which subjects have presented
have often seemed Sargent&#39;s inspiration
in landscape: rocks presenting surfaces to
the light with a thousand variations; the
wet basins of bronze fountains receiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
coloured reflections and the diamond lights
in the fountain splashes; grey architecture
with its soft shadows, architecture
white in the sun with its cool blue shadows,
like fragments of night in the doorways.
It is this mysterious sensation of light and
shadow alternating everywhere, changing
the colour of the day itself as the day
advances, which Sargent meets. He is
one of the few painters who have faced
the noon. He has this great command of
art&#39;s slender resources, and he is matter-of-fact
enough to be happy at this uncompromising
time of day, unbelieved in by
the workers, so inconsiderate to the lazy
with its heat. The noon has not many
with its praises, and &quot;all great art is
praise.&quot; Painters have got up at dawn to
communicate to us its everyday recurring
freshness, as of an eternal spring, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
has not evening always been the painter&#39;s
hour? Sargent has faced the noon, which
demands so much sensitiveness that the
over-sensitive shrink. His brush has given
it in water-colours the finest interpretation
it has yet received.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class="indent">To go back to the matter of composition
again. In his portrait groups, where
the mere fact that the sitters have to be
grouped implies that he is not dealing
from the start with an impression direct,
we find he is a master of the finest composition,
as in his group of Mrs. Carl
Meyer and children. And yet to one who
will take not one touch with his brush
from what is not before him, such a view
of his subject must be incalculable in its
difficulties.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
The painter has never made a passage
of painting the excuse for incongruity. The
arrangements in his pictures are always
probable. It is legitimate in many cases
that they should only be imaginatively probable.
Any arrangement is probable in a
studio, and affording themselves too much
licence in this respect some painters wonder
why the public are inclined to discredit
most of what they do. The logical quality,
the sanity of Sargent&#39;s art is yet another
reason for its vogue; it has not the unreasonableness
of studio production, it
commends itself to a world that perhaps is
not wrong in assuming that the artistic
licence is applied for by those who are not
sane. Sargent has on occasion had to resort
to all sorts of devices to obtain effects
and composition that he has desired, but
he has always kept faith with the public,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
and had the true artist&#39;s regard for their
illusions. He allows his sitters to wear
their best clothes, but he never dresses
them up; no, to please him they must wholly
belong to the life of which they are a part,
it is the attitude in which they interest
him and all of us. We have then to
think of Sargent not only as a painter, but
as the maker of human documents&mdash;like
Balzac, the creator of imperishable characters&mdash;with
this advantage over Balzac,
that all his characters have especially sat
to him. It is how posterity will undoubtedly
regard this array of brilliant pictures. Of
the people they will know nothing but the
legend of their actions and Sargent&#39;s record
of their face. We have undoubtedly felt
that when a man of real distinction of
mind has worn them, the top hat and
cylindrical trouser leg were not so bad.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
They have indeed, under the influence of
personality, seemed on occasions the most
august and distinguished garments in the
world. But there must come disillusion,
the humour of it all will some day dawn,
but it will not be before a Sargent picture.
He has at any rate immortalised those
things, just as Velazquez has made beautiful
for ever the outrageous clothes in which
his Infantas were imprisoned. We are reconciled
to such things in art by the same
process as we are in life, in Sargent&#39;s case
by the unforgettable rendering of the distinction
of many of his sitters.</p>

<p class="indent">It is the work of the secondary artist
that is always perfect&mdash;of its sort; for it
will not accept its reward, to wit, the
finished picture, until the last effort has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
been expended. With the masters of the
first order, it is otherwise. We have said
they paint as they think; who but the
amateur always thinks at his best? When
a man&#39;s art has become a part of him, it
suffers with his moods. He always works,
and his work is always his companion, an
indulgence. In his exalted moments it rises
to heights by which we estimate his genius,
but which sensible criticism does not expect
him to live up to, any more than we
expect a brilliant conversationalist always to
be equally brilliant. This is why a master&#39;s
work is always so interesting. That it
has become so flexible an expression of
his own nature is its charm, if we really
regard it as art, and do not look upon the
artist as a manufacturer who must be reliable,
who having once turned out of his
workshop a work of surpassing perfection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
must be expected to keep to that standard
or be classed with the defaulting tradesman
whose goods do not come up to his sample.
A painter makes or mars his own reputation
by the care or carelessness of his
work, but it is his own work, and he is not
under any obligation to us to keep it up to
a certain standard if it does not interest
him to sacrifice everything for that standard.
Sargent&#39;s work has been splendidly unequal.
Sometimes it has been disillusioned,
tired, at other times all his energy has
seemed gathered up into a <i>tour de force</i>.
An intensity there is about Sargent&#39;s
earlier work which we cannot find in some
of his later pictures, sureness of itself has
brought freedom and with it freedom&#39;s
qualities, which we must take pleasure in
for their own sake.</p>

<p class="indent">It is frequently enough the weakness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
painters to return constantly in their art to
some particular gesture or arrangement in
which their mastery is complete. This has
not been the case with Sargent; instead,
his mastery has completed itself only
through a constant encounter with new
difficulties.</p>

<p class="indent">A quality of all great art is reticence,
something which will never let the master,
to whom it is not disastrous to be careless,
be so; for carelessness nearly always means
over-statement, and exaggeration. Ah!
just the qualities if a work of art is to
arrest attention in a modern exhibition.
A common question at the Royal Academy
is &quot;Where are the Sargents?&quot; by some
enthusiastic visitor who has passed them
several times. No, Sargent&#39;s victories do
not startle, winged victories do not, but
advertisements do.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span></p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p class="indent">Sargent was born of American parents
in Florence in 1856, and passed his boyhood
there. No art, it would seem at first,
is further away than his from all the Florentine
traditions, and yet in the decorative
colour values, which give distinction to his
finest works, he is the child of Florence.
The Renaissance attitude towards life itself
was highly imaginative, so into visionary art
reality was carried. Consulting the origin
of all their visions, the Florentines returned
imaginatively to what was real. It is the
beauty of reality which is the fervour of
their great designs, and as a humanist,
Sargent is their descendant.</p>

<p class="indent">When, at the age of nineteen, he came
to Paris, he was already, we are told, an
artist of promise, and he went to Carolus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
Duran with youth&#39;s conscious, ardent necessity
of embracing a fresh view of the world
altogether. The lighter touch of Carolus
Duran, the worldly painting, the lively art
of things living, if a superficial art, was
refreshing, no doubt, to one accustomed
only to the beautiful memories of ardour
expressed five centuries before. And superficiality,
demoralising to the superficial,
could only give some added swiftness to a
brush inclined to halt with too much intensity
whilst life, its one enthusiasm, was
racing by. He never experimented under
Carolus Duran. He was beginning that unerring
sensitiveness of painting, which is
only learnt by drudgery, the almost luxuriously
easy virtuosity, before the acquirement
of which, complete freedom of expression
cannot begin, or sympathy declare itself as
from a well-played instrument.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
An artist with individuality is careless
of asserting it, and it is perhaps just the
one thing in the world which cannot but
assert itself. Those who strive for originality
through the unaccustomed may without
hesitation be put down as those who
are without confidence in their own nature.
The individuality of Sargent, as striking
as any in his day, is unself-consciously expressed.
If we could strain from a work
of art the self-conscious, which is always
the unnatural element, all that ever gave
it any force would still be left in it. Submitted
to this test, how much so-called
originality would crumble, while the individualism
of Sargent still remained.</p>

<p class="indent">When leaving the studio of Carolus
Duran, he painted a portrait of that painter,
a summing, as it were, of all he owed to
him before he courted another influence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
He went to Madrid, there to study the living
elements of art in the school of a dead
master, Velazquez, in whose life encompassing
art nothing has gone out of fashion&mdash;no,
not even the farthingale which the
children wear. It was early in the eighties
that the Spanish visit ended and Sargent
worked in Paris, already a man of note,
for the Carolus Duran portrait had been
followed by &quot;Portrait of a Young Lady,&quot;
exhibited in 1881, and &quot;En route pour la
PÃªche&quot; and &quot;Smoke of Ambergris.&quot; In
1882 he exhibited the <i>tour de force</i> &quot;El
Jaleo,&quot; the sensation of the season, and
immediately afterwards the &quot;Portraits of
Children&quot;&mdash;the four children in a dimly-lighted
hall, one of the most well-remembered
of his pictures of that time. Then
came the wonderful &quot;Madame Gautreau.&quot;
Paris was his headquarters but his visits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
to England were frequent, and they grew
more frequent as the time went on and as
his reputation grew in London. It was
about half-a-dozen years after the Spanish
visit that he came to this country to live
here permanently and make his art our own.
He was elected an Associate of the Royal
Academy in 1894, a Royal Academician
in 1897.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p class="indent">We should say something of Sargent&#39;s
influence on contemporary art, which has
been immense. It has been thought that,
deceived by the brilliance of his results,
with their great air of spontaneity, younger
painters have been led astray. This, we
believe, is a mistake. The weakest go to
the wall, but it is probable that the example
of Sargent has succeeded in lifting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
the whole standard of painting in the
country, bringing&mdash;even the great incompetent,
within measuring distance of a
useful ideal; an ideal of sympathy disciplined
with every touch, and an ideal of
difficult things. Is not Art always difficult?
It has been so to Sargent, with everything
at his fingers&#39; ends; with everything so
much at his fingers&#39; ends that under
special circumstances he once completed
a life-size three-quarter length portrait in
a single day. He was in America, and
had promised to paint the portrait. The
sittings were put off, and at last the friend
who was to sit was suddenly called away;
but Sargent came with his materials in
the morning, and the sitter gave him the
day. They were probably both nearly dead
at the end of it, but a large finished painting
had been begun and ended.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
Sargent&#39;s countrymen have appreciated
every manifestation of his gifts. Lately
he exhibited eighty-three of his water-colours
in Brooklyn. He will not part with
them singly. Brooklyn enthusiastically
bought the whole collection for its Art
Museum.</p>

<p class="indent">Fame has not spoilt his retiring nature,
and even by his art a barrier is raised,
in front of which the master will not
show himself, but I hope it is an intimacy
that we have established with him in his
art. Mine is but the privilege of murmuring
the introduction, and any charges to be
brought against me must be laid at
Sargent&#39;s door. For a great artist creates
not only his art, but that which it inspires.
This is indeed the mysterious province of
artistic creation; the artist creating beyond
his art that which comes into our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
minds through contact with it; so framing
our thoughts and setting in motion waves
infinitely continued in the thoughts that
pass through every man to his companions.</p>
